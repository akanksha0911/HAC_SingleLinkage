Hierarchical Clustering Single Linkage/average/complete
Hierarchical algorithms can be further divided into divisive algorithms and agglomerative algorithms. Divisive clustering begins with all data elements in one cluster, which is later successively divided into smaller ones. On the other hand, agglomerative clustering begins with single-element clusters and works by successively merging them into larger ones.
